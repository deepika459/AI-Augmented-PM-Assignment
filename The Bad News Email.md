**Scenario : Appointment Rescheduling Feature**

Hi Team, the appointment rescheduling feature requires additional validation to ensure schedules update correctly across all users. We will demonstrate booking and cancellation in Thursday’s demo and present rescheduling in the next session on Monday. This ensures appointment changes work reliably without affecting existing bookings.
