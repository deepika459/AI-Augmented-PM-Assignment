Subject: Change Request – WhatsApp Reminder Feature

Hi Team,

We have reviewed the request to include the WhatsApp reminder feature and would like to share the expected impact and available options.

**Changes to Consider (Impact Analysis):**

**Scope:**  
WhatsApp booking reminders will require additional setup, integration, and testing effort.

**Timeline:**  
The MVP launch will be delayed by approximately one week if the feature is included in the current release.

**Cost:**  
An additional cost of $25,000 is expected due to third-party integration, backend updates, notification scheduling, testing, and deployment activities.

**Decision Options:**

**Option 1 – Include in current release:**  
We can add the WhatsApp reminder in the current release with an expected delay of about one week.

**Option 2 – Include in next release:**  
We can proceed with the planned launch and deliver the WhatsApp reminder in the immediate next update after go-live.

Please let us know your preferred option and priority. Our goal is to ensure the feature is delivered smoothly without affecting system stability.

Sincerely,  
Deepika Kumari
